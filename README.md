# SOFT SHADER

Soft Shader contains a few shadertoy ports to C++ / SDL2
for the sake of learning a couple new C++ features.

I chose to go the software renderer route because seeing
GPU shaders done in software is somewhat pretty cool.

## Building

    pacman -S sdl2
    make

Then, run any of the binaries built:

    ./tunnel
